    <h2>Description of Scrambled Eggs</h2>

    <p>Scrambled eggs are a quick and easy breakfast dish made by whisking eggs and cooking them gently in a pan until they form soft, creamy curds. They can be enjoyed plain or with various mix-ins like cheese, vegetables, or herbs.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk or cream (optional for creamier texture)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter or oil</li>
        <li>Optional mix-ins: cheese, chopped herbs, diced vegetables, etc.</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Procedure</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beat the Eggs:</strong>In a bowl, crack 4 large eggs. Add 1/4 cup of milk or cream (if using) and a pinch of salt and pepper. Whisk until the mixture is well combined and slightly frothy.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Pan:</strong>Place a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium-low heat. Add 1 tablespoon of butter or oil and let it melt and coat the pan evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Eggs:</strong><p>Pour the beaten eggs into the pan. Let them sit undisturbed for a few moments until they start to set around the edges.</p><p>Using a spatula, gently push the eggs from the edges toward the center. Continue to cook, stirring gently and continuously, until the eggs form soft curds and are mostly set but still slightly runny. This should take about 3-5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Add Mix-ins (Optional):</strong>If you are adding cheese, chopped herbs, or diced vegetables, stir them in during the last minute of cooking, allowing them to warm through and incorporate into the eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish Cooking:</strong>Remove the pan from the heat just before the eggs are fully cooked. The residual heat will finish cooking them, ensuring they stay soft and creamy.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>Serve the scrambled eggs immediately, garnished with additional herbs or a sprinkle of cheese if desired.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Enjoy your fluffy and delicious scrambled eggs!</p>
